Added support for AWS session tokens in salt-cloud.

Previously, salt-cloud would only accept the id and key variables when authenticating with AWS. This change adds support for the token variable, which is used to authenticate with AWS when a session token is required.

*To use this feature, set the token variable in the salt-cloud config. For example:
ec2:
id: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
key: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
token: YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN
*This change will allow users to use salt-cloud to create and manage AWS instances even when a session token is required
